- Live presence indicator

**Implementation Steps**:
1. User manager backend
2. User profiles storage
3. Presence integration
4. API endpoints
5. Frontend UI
6. E2E tests

---

### 4. Heating Efficiency Reports ⏳
**Status**: Architecture complete, implementation pending
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Complexity**: HIGH

Show which areas are heating efficiently vs struggling.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Efficiency score per area (0-100)
- Metrics: heating time %, temperature stability, cycle count
- Daily/weekly/monthly reports
- Recommendations for low-scoring areas
- Charts and visualizations

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Efficiency calculator backend
2. Statistics API integration
3. API endpoint
4. Frontend analytics page
5. Charts and visualizations
6. E2E tests

---

### 5. Historical Comparisons ⏳
**Status**: Architecture complete, implementation pending
**Priority**: LOW
**Complexity**: HIGH

Compare current heating performance to previous periods.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Week-to-week comparisons
- Month-to-month comparisons
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Custom date range comparisons
- Delta indicators (better/worse)

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Comparison engine backend
2. Historical data queries
3. API endpoint
4. Frontend analytics page
5. Comparison charts
6. E2E tests

---

## Implementation Priority

Based on value vs complexity:

### Phase 1 (High Value, Low/Medium Complexity)
1. **Vacation Mode** - Quick win, high user demand
2. **Import/Export** - Critical for backup/restore

### Phase 2 (Medium Value, Medium Complexity)
3. **Multi-User Presence** - Builds on existing presence features

### Phase 3 (Medium Value, High Complexity)
4. **Efficiency Reports** - Requires history analysis
5. **Historical Comparisons** - Advanced analytics

---

## Documentation

### Completed ✅
- V0.6.0_ARCHITECTURE.md - Full technical architecture
- This roadmap document

### To Do
- Update README.md with v0.6.0 feature previews
- Update DEVELOPER.md with implementation guidelines
- Create E2E test specifications

---

## Testing Strategy

Each feature will have:
- Unit tests (Python backend)
- Integration tests (API endpoints)
- E2E tests (Playwright frontend)
- Manual testing checklist

---

## Release Strategy

### Alpha Release (v0.6.0-alpha)
- Vacation Mode only
- Import/Export only
- Limited testing, feedback gathering

### Beta Release (v0.6.0-beta)
- Add Multi-User Presence
- Expanded testing
- Bug fixes from alpha

### Stable Release (v0.6.0)
- All features complete
- Full E2E test coverage
- Documentation complete
- Performance validated

---

## Current Status

**Version**: v0.5.7 (stable)
**Next Version**: v0.6.0-alpha (in planning)
**Target Date**: TBD based on development time

---

## Notes

This is an ambitious release. Features may be split across multiple versions if needed:
- v0.6.0: Vacation Mode + Import/Export
- v0.7.0: Multi-User Presence
- v0.8.0: Analytics (Efficiency + Comparisons)

Feedback welcome on feature priorities!
